According to WHO (World Health Organization), over 1.2 million people die every year and over 50 million are injured in traffic, with the intention of reducing these numbers and the will to make the world a better place through technology, we created the Traffic Officer.

An Open Source initiative to help governments identify and punish violators of traffic laws. It is known that the number of cars increases worldwide, hindering the work of the traffic agents.

The Traffic Officer is divided into two parts, a mobile client and a server API:

 - The mobile application will be able to identify in real time of traffic offenses and send video clips or sequence of photos (through wi-fi or LTE, in real time or not) to the server.
 So every person who has a smartphone or tablet with camera and mobile application Traffic Officer running, becomes a client, simply place it on a stand, pointing to the street and it becomes a traffic officer and begins to contribute to decrease accidents.

 - The server will be responsible for identifying offenders vehicles, choose the best videos or photos among those sent by various clients and send to the responsible authorities.

Developer, designer, journalist, investors, everyone is so welcome.

The project is at the beginning, we are still defining what would be the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), choosing the library to discover images, choosing the language to API, we're starting with Android or iOS client, site creation, choice of name, etc. So right now what we need most is the participation of all in discussions with ideas, criticisms and suggestions.

The github project is divided into:
